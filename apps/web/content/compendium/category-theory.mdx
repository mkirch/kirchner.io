# Category Theory

Category theory is a unifying theory in mathematics that abstracts mathematical concepts and relationships between them into collections of objects and arrows.

## Fundamental Concepts

### Categories
- **Definition**: Collection of objects and morphisms between them
- **Properties**:
  - Composition of morphisms
  - Identity morphisms
  - Associativity
  - Unit laws

### Functors
- **Definition**: Structure-preserving maps between categories
- **Types**:
  - Covariant functors
  - Contravariant functors
  - Endofunctors
  - Bifunctors

### Natural Transformations
- **Definition**: Morphisms between functors
- **Properties**:
  - Naturality squares
  - Component maps
  - Vertical composition
  - Horizontal composition

## Advanced Concepts

### Universal Properties
- **Definition**: Characterizations of mathematical structures through their relationships
- **Examples**:
  - Products and coproducts
  - Limits and colimits
  - Adjoint functors
  - Kan extensions

### Adjunctions
- **Definition**: Pairs of functors with special relationships
- **Properties**:
  - Unit and counit
  - Adjoint functor theorem
  - Examples in various categories
  - Applications

### Monads and Comonads
- **Definition**: Endofunctors with additional structure
- **Components**:
  - Unit and multiplication
  - Kleisli category
  - Eilenberg-Moore category
  - Applications in programming
