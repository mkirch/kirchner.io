# Theorem Proving

Theorem proving is the use of mathematical logic and computational methods to verify mathematical statements and solve complex problems. It combines formal logic, mathematics, and computer science to create rigorous proofs of mathematical theorems.

## Approaches

### Automated Theorem Proving (ATP)
- Fully automated systems that find proofs without human intervention
- Uses resolution, tableaux methods, and term rewriting
- Suitable for well-defined problem domains
- Examples: Vampire, E Theorem Prover, Z3

### Interactive Theorem Proving (ITP)
- Human-guided proof development
- Provides mechanized verification of each step
- Allows complex mathematical reasoning
- Examples: Coq, Isabelle/HOL, Lean

### SAT/SMT Solving
- Boolean satisfiability (SAT) and Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT)
- Efficient automated reasoning for specific domains
- Used in software verification and hardware design
- Examples: Z3, CVC4, Yices
