# Multimodal AI

Multimodal AI is a field of artificial intelligence that explores how to combine information from multiple modalities, such as vision, language, and audio.

## Perception, Reasoning, and Action 

We perceive the world through our senses, such as vision, hearing, and touch. We reason about the world through our knowledge and beliefs. We act on the world through our bodies. 

Machines can also perceive the world through sensors, such as cameras, microphones, and touch sensors. Machines can reason about the world through knowledge bases and machine learning models. Machines can act on the world through robotic bodies. 

The latent space will grow from text to text and text to image, to a blend of every perception and action we can do. It's a very exciting time to be in AI. And an important state in human evolution.
