# Anomalies

High strangeness, weirdness, and the unexplained. Anomalies are the things that don't fit into the neat little boxes of our understanding. They are the outliers, the exceptions, the things that defy explanation. They are the mysteries that keep us up at night, the questions that haunt us, the enigmas that challenge our assumptions about the world.
