## Formative web writing, from my pov

- Legendary tribute goes to the now defunct [Hipster Runoff](https://www.hipsterrunoff.com), RIP. Carles brought some insane takes that still live with me, such as his poignant and bold essay on the state of America ["Where have all the Chili's gone?"](https://web.archive.org/web/20110112174258/http://www.hipsterrunoff.com/2011/01/where-have-all-chilis-gone.html). This is further testament to the necessity of [archive.org](archive.org)'s continued existence.

- Maddox is insane and great, deserves recognition here for being bold and brave @ [TheBestPageInTheUniverse](http://maddox.xmission.com/).

## Useful

- [kravchyk](https://www.kravchyk.com) taught me how to properly [deal with TS exports](https://www.kravchyk.com/typescript-npm-package-json-exports/)

- [karmaniverous](https://karmanivero.us/) taught me the [Karmic Rules for Writing
Pretty Good Code](https://github.com/karmaniverous/rules) and also has an underrated [template](https://github.com/karmaniverous/npm-package-template-ts) for `npm` + TS packages
