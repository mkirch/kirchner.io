# Overlanding: An Encyclopedic Resource

Overlanding is more than just a journey; it's a lifestyle. This page serves as a comprehensive guide to understanding and engaging in overlanding, from the basics to advanced tips and tricks.

## What is Overlanding?

Overlanding is self-reliant travel to remote destinations where the journey is the primary goal. It's about exploration, adventure, and enjoying the journey as much as the destination.


The term "overlanding" originally referred to livestock herding over long distances in Australia.


## Electronics for Extended Travel

Extending your battery's life and capabilities is important. You don't want to run your battery dead by using it to power all the other things you brought with you.

I have a 2018 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited  with a 3.6L V6 engine. It comes equipped with a 220-amp alternator, one main battery, and an auxiliary battery located behind the main battery, which supports the Engine Start/Stop (ESS) system. 

After the main battery, I have added a second battery to increase my overall capacity. This is a 100-amp hour battery that I use to power my fridge, lights, and other electronics.
