# Rust

Rust is exploding in popularity as a kind of modern blend of C++ performance and Python user-friendliness, with some differences that make it a systems programming language that is fast, memory safe, and thread safe.

To learn Rust for Python developers, a good project is to take something written in Python, then rewrite it in Rust for speed, safety, and parallelism, and then can then provide a Python wrapper for it to use it again in Python the way you always did. Many popular Python libraries are now being rewritten in Rust under the hood and then wrapped in Python for use in Python projects, with faster code and no change in user experience.

Rust is great for writing and distributing command line tools, web servers, and desktop applications, and all sorts of things. It's quite portable too, so you can build and run natively without installing anything else on Windows, Linux, and macOS. There are tons of other build targets available like Android, iOS, and WebAssembly. It's pretty easy to go from high-level to low-level and back again.

Rust is becoming extensively used in the AI and machine learning space, as many popular tools are embracing it.

## Books and Documentation for Learning Rust

1. [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) - This is the official book on Rust; a comprehensive resource for reading and understanding Rust, written by the Rust team.
2. [Rust by Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/) - A collection of runnable examples that illustrate various Rust concepts and standard libraries.
3. [The Rust Programming Language (2nd Edition)](https://nostarch.com/rust-programming-language-2nd-edition) - A physical book that provides a deep dive into Rust, written by members of the Rust team.
4. [Rust and WebAssembly](https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/book/) - This book provides an overview of using Rust to generate WebAssembly and interact with JavaScript.

## Tools Developed in Rust

### Command Line Tools

Some of my favorites CLI tools written in Rust:

- [ripgrep (rg)](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) - Recursively searches your dir for regex matches, replacement for `grep`, `ack`, and `ag`.
- [sd](https://github.com/chmln/sd) - Simpler `sed`, for **S**earch and **D**isplace.
- [bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat) - A `cat` clone with syntax highlighting and Git integration.
- [eza](https://github.com/eza-community/eza) - A modern replacement for `ls` (maintained version of `exa` as of 2024).
- [fd](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd) - A simple, fast and user-friendly alternative to `find`.
- [tokei](https://github.com/XAMPPRocky/tokei) - Counts your code, quickly.
- [dust](https://github.com/bootandy/dust) - A more intuitive version of `du` in Rust.
- [hyperfine](https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine) - A command-line benchmarking tool.
- [procs](https://github.com/dalance/procs) - A modern replacement for `ps` written in Rust.
- [zoxide](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide) - A faster `cd` replacement to navigate your filesystem.
- [mdbook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook) - A utility to create modern online books from Markdown files.

### Web Servers

- [Actix](https://actix.rs/) - A powerful, pragmatic, and extremely fast web framework for Rust.

### AI and Machine Learning

- [Tokenizers](https://github.com/huggingface/tokenizers) - Hugging Face tokenizers library.
- [Tch.rs]

## Package Registries

- [Crates.io](https://crates.io/) - The Rust community's crate host. You can publish your Rust projects here for others to use.
- [lib.rs](https://lib.rs/) - An alternative to crates.io, lib.rs also hosts Rust packages but with a different interface.

Remember, the best way to learn Rust is by writing Rust code. Don't be afraid to dive in and start a project, even if you feel overwhelmed. The Rust community is incredibly supportive and is a great resource if you get stuck.
