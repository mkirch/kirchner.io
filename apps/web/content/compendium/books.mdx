## General Advice on Caring for Books

- Don't store books in a humid environment or direct sunlight. They will fade, warp, discolor, and disintegrate. Abra-cadabra.
- Ensure the books are stored upright, with the spine supported.
- If the book has a dust jacket, ensure it is in good condition and not damaged. 
- Use a dehumidifier to dry books or dust jackets if they are damp. 
- Mold will ruin your life. Pay close attention to humidity, and keep an eye out for signs of mold.
- Mylar is your friend.
- If the dust jacket is brittle, consider removing it, and it can be stored in a mylar sleeve, then either stored separately or wrapped back around the book in the sleeve. 
- If the book has a slipcase, ensure it is in good condition and not damaged.
- Push the book well back into the shelf, so that the spine is not touching the spine of the book next to it. It's better to have some space between the spines than to them uniformly touching at the spine.
- Don't be afraid of touching the book. Books are meant to be touched. They are meant to be read.
- Should you organize your books by color, know that I admire your collection and your free will to organize your books any way you want, I do not understand you.
- Don't use gloves to handle a book, or most any other priceless object. This is not a Discovery Channel special where scientists are on display and force themselves to look cool. It's real life. You need your hands to be free to enjoy the object, to observe it properly, and it's actually safer, as the tactile sense is the best way to know if you are causing damage.
- If you have a book that is falling apart, consider having it rebound.
- Thou shalt not stack books carelessly. Your ancestors watch and weep.
- If a book is special, read it. If a book is rare, read it. If a book is beautiful, read it. If a book is rare and beautiful, read it twice.
- Let others borrow your books, including your most precious ones. Just don't forget to write down who has what.

## History of Books

### Manuscripts and Codices

Before the printing press, books were handwritten. This was a laborious process, and the availability of books was limited to the wealthy and powerful.

These are called "manuscripts" or "codices" in the medieval era, and were often illuminated and decorated.  

### Incunabula

**Incunabula** (singular: _incunabulum_) refers to books, pamphlets, or other printed works produced during the earliest stages of printing in Europe, specifically before the year 1501. The term originates from the Latin word incunabula, meaning “swaddling clothes” or “cradle,” symbolizing the “infancy” of printing technology.

	1.	Printed with Movable Type: These works were created using Gutenberg’s revolutionary movable type printing press, which emerged around 1450.
	2.	Transition from Manuscripts: Incunabula often mimic the style of handwritten manuscripts, featuring similar typefaces and layouts.
	3.	Hand Decoration: Some incunabula were hand-illuminated or decorated after printing, blending the new technology with traditional bookmaking techniques.
	4.	Limited Editions: They were typically printed in small runs, making them rare and valuable today.

Incunabula mark the transition from medieval manuscript culture to the modern age of mass communication. They contributed to the spread of the Renaissance, Reformation, and scientific revolution.

Some Notable Incunabula:
- The Gutenberg Bible (~1455): The first substantial book printed using movable type.
- Nuremberg Chronicle (1493): A richly illustrated world history.
- Early editions of classical works by authors like Aristotle, Virgil, and Cicero.

Incunabula are highly prized by collectors and scholars. Libraries and museums often maintain special collections to study and preserve these early printed books due to their historical and cultural importance.
