## Less-Known Intrigues


- The [Faiyum Oasis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faiyum_Oasis) and [Lake Moeris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Moeris) were connected by a canal, which was used to transport water from the Nile to the Fayum Oasis. Herodotus mentions this lake and canal as being artificial, as well as there being a structure of two pyramids as tall as Khufu's. Some on this region and site can be found [here](https://www.gigalresearch.com/uk/publications-biahmu.php)
- Symbolism of [Isis and Nephthys](https://isiopolis.com/2024/09/08/isis-nephthys-work-magic-for-you-with-knotted-cords/) as the two sisters of Osiris, who were the daughters of Geb and Nut, and wife and step-sister of Osiris, and who worked to piece together the body of Osiris after his murder by Seth.

- [Your name in hieroglyphs](http://www.qenherkhopeshef.org/nomHieroPHP/): I did (along with a friend of mine who produced a concurrent product) the very first "name in hieroglyphs" page on the web. At that time (1994), the lab computer would slow down when people asked for their names. Now, this is a PHP version, much more optimized (the original one created a LaTeX file, ran LaTeX, then produced a postscript file which was finally transformed into a gif).

## JSesh Sources (GitHub)

JSesh sources are now available on [GitHub](https://github.com/rosmord/jsesh).

## JSesh Sign List

It might be important to be able to compare signs from a JSesh version to another. Starting with JSesh 7.5.5, I have decided to publish a PDF document to that purpose. It's a plain list, without any comment; the sole purpose is to display the way a certain code is used in a given version of JSesh.

## Alternatives to JSesh

There are a number of other hieroglyphic word processors. Many of them are not distributed anymore, but when they still have a website, I provide a link.

- Winglyph: Successor to Glyph, written by Hans van den Berg for the CCER (Center for Computer-aided Egyptological Research); was used for many epoch-making publications, such as the *Chapelles Osiriennes de Dendera*.
- Macscribe: The first editor written for Mac, written by Éric Aubourg; was also distributed by the CCER.
- Inscribe: Developed by Bob Richmond (Saqqarah Technology); was very well integrated with early versions of Windows, through *Object Linking and Embedding*, a technology which allowed easy communication between software.
- [Webglyph](http://71.174.62.16/Demo/WebGlyph2): An improved online port of the original Glyph software, by its authors, Ed J.P.M. de Moel and Jan Buurman; you can either request a personal code or (according to the mail in the EEF list use code *guest* both as login and password.
- VisualGlyph: A *facsimile* oriented editor, which allows one to mix hieroglyphs and drawing.
- [IGlyph](https://aegyptologie.philhist.unibas.ch/de/forschung/werkzeuge/iglyph/): By Ivan Subotic and Günther Lapp, successor to VisualGlyph.
- Got: Developed by Michel Guay et Charles Bédard, with very nice XVIIIth dynasty glyphs, along with a rich documentation.
- [SignWriter](http://www.egyptologysoftware.com/egypt/index.html): A recent and active system by Phil Robinson; couple a hieroglyphic editor with a dictionary.

## Mark-Jan Nederhof's Softwares

Mark-Jan is a professor of computer science, and a respected expert in Natural Language Processing. He has a number of very interesting tools for Egyptian and hieroglyphs. They probably lack a bit of user-friendly polish if you want to create data for them, but they are very powerful.

- [RES](https://mjn.host.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/egyptian/res/): The *Revised Encoding Scheme*, is an alternative to the Manuel de Codage, with very powerful operators. He has a wonderful JavaScript implementation.
- [PhilologEg](https://mjn.host.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/egyptian/align/): A text database in RES format, which is able to display parallel texts in a very nice way. Hidden in the code of PhilologEg, you will find an OCR for ancient Egyptian.
- [GitHub Projects](https://github.com/nederhof): Notably:
  - [hocr](https://github.com/nederhof/hocr): A more recent OCR.
  - [isut](https://github.com/nederhof/isut): A software to deal with hieratic texts.

## Sites About Hieroglyphs

- The [Thot sign list](https://thotsignlist.org) project at the University of Liège.
- The [Polychrome Hieroglyph Research Project](https://www.phrp.be), by David Nunn; lots of iconographical sources.

## About Hieroglyphs and Unicode

Unicode contains a sizeable number of signs, enough at least to cover most needs for Hieratic texts; from Unicode 12 onward, a number of operators from the Manuel de Codage have been added.

- [Andrew Glass's font tools project](https://github.com/microsoft/font-tools), which provides a [SIL-licensed font](https://github.com/microsoft/font-tools/tree/main/EgyptianOpenType/font) which supports the advanced operators in Unicode. The font is called `eot.ttf`.
- [Hieroglyphs Everywhere](http://hieroglyphseverywhere.blogspot.com), from Bob Richmond, dedicated to Unicode and hieroglyphs.
- [SINUHE the Hierotyper](https://github.com/somiyagawa/SINUHE-the-Hierotyper): A software developed by Marwan Kilani, So Miyagawa, and David Chapman, to type hieroglyphic texts using Unicode.
- [Opentypehiero](https://github.com/nederhof/opentypehiero): Hieroglyphic fonts for Unicode, with a software to adapt them to specific needs, with operator support.
- [HieroJax](https://nederhof.github.io/hierojax): By Mark-Jan Nederhof (see also his other softwares, above).

## Useful Egyptological Links

- The [Modern version of the Thesaurus Linguae Aegyptiae](https://thesaurus-linguae-aegyptiae.de/home), one of the most ambitious projects about Ancient Egyptian Language, now with many more hieroglyphic spellings.
- The [Thesaurus Linguae Aegyptiae](http://aaew.bbaw.de/tla/index.html), the original software; it also gives access to the original files of the Wörterbuch; a treasure trove.
- The [Ramses Project](http://ramses.ulg.ac.be).
- [Simon Schweitzer's Ancient Egyptian Dictionary](https://simondschweitzer.github.io/aed/) [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.3581069.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3581069): A nice website and mobile application which uses the data from the [Thesaurus Linguae Aegyptiae](http://aaew.bbaw.de/tla/index.html). It's open source, so you can also do some processing on the data itself.
- [ORAEC](https://oraec.github.io/): An ambitious project for Digital Humanities in Egyptology. Aggregates lots of resources. Among which:
  - A [meta-search engine for sequences of signs in various projects](https://oraec.github.io/corpus/search/search_hieroglyphs.html) (ORAEC, PNM, Prosopographia Aegypti, Ramsès, and TLA).
  - A [meta-search engine for hieroglyphic word forms in various projects](https://oraec.github.io/corpus/search/search_hieroglyphic_word_forms.html) (ORAEC, PNM, Prosopographia Aegypti, Ramsès, and TLA).

For learners:
