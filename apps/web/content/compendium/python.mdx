# Python

## Environments 

Keep it simple. New project? Go to the project directory and run these.

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -U pip
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Ez. 


## Libraries 

In general, use libraries that have frequent updates, are actively and well-maintained, and typically these have a large or growing community. Good libraries of recent have used Rust to implement the core logic in a fast and secure way, and then expose a Python API to the user, so that all the good stuff works, and the annoying stuff is under the hood. `[Tokenizers](https://github.com/huggingface/tokenizers)` is a good example of this pattern.

### My Favorite Python Libraries

These are good for most Python projects. I keep them handy for just about every `requirements.txt` I work start.

- `[rich](https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich)` for pretty printing.
- `[click](https://github.com/pallets/click)` for building command line interfaces.
- `[tqdm](https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm)` for progress bars.
- `[ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff)` for linting, formatting, import sorting,and type checking. I no longer use `[black](https://github.com/psf/black)` for formatting, or `isort` for import sorting, because it's good enough to just use `ruff` for that.
- `[pytest](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest)` for testing.
- `[pydantic](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic)` for data validation.
- `[polars](https://github.com/pola-rs/polars)` for data manipulation. Like `pandas` on crack.
- Stop using `requests` and start using `aiohttp`+`asyncio` to get async fast HTTP requests. You may be shocked at how efficient it is.
  - `[aiohttp](https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp)` for HTTP. 
  - `[asyncio](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html)` for async programming.
