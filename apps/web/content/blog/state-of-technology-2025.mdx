# The State of Technology as We Enter 2025

## Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning

With no shortage of hype, AI is undoubtedly one of the most significant technological advancements of the past decade, and it's only getting started. The rollercoaster will continue, hype cycles will wax and wane, and the impact on society will be profound regardless of what pundits may forecast.

### Large Shifts in the Labor Market Due to AI, Now and in the Future

Extraordinary impacts are already being felt in the labor market, and we're only scratching the surface of what's to come.

#### The First Wave: Disrupting Creative and Task-Oriented Labor

AI agents are causing shifts in labor power. The first wave of impacts to jobs by AI began in the past few years, quickly beginning to displace creative and task-oriented labor across various industries. Deemed the "Generative AI" boom, it primarily involved LLMs and diffusion models generating text or images in one-shot or few-shot manners. These models are continually improving and are evolving into multi-modal systems that generate text, images, and audio, using each of these modalities as input contexts. The rapid transition from "text-to-text" to "any-to-any" is a paradigm shift for those already struggling to grasp the implications of the former in their workflows.

#### The Second Wave: AI Agents and Reasoning Models

While multi-modality is becoming standard, we're seeing the rise of agents and reasoning models like OpenAI's o1 line, including `o1-preview` and `o1-mini`. These models are trained with actions in mind, much like agents interacting with their environment over time. Advances in reinforcement learning and RLHF have enabled the development of multi-modal world models as training environments.

This new set of agent-based modeling capabilities is profound. AI agents can now perform complex tasks requiring understanding and interaction within dynamic environments. For example, autonomous customer service bots handle intricate queries, and coding assistants generate and debug code. These developments herald a new phase in labor power shifts, affecting creative workers, programmers, and even scientists.

We are entering an era where new professions will emerge while others decline. Adaptation will be crucial, and it's my hope we will support each other through these transitions to build a better future.

#### The Third Wave: Embodied AI and Multi-Agent Systems

Looking ahead, the next frontier in AI involves embodied intelligence and the collaboration of multiple AI agents.

**Embodied AI** integrates physical robots with advanced AI, enabling machines to interact with the real world in sophisticated ways. Imagine robots navigating complex environments, performing intricate manufacturing tasks, or assisting in high-precision surgeries.

**Multi-agent systems** involve AI entities working together or in competition, leading to emergent behaviors and solutions to complex problems. For instance, AI agents could optimize smart city traffic, manage supply chains, or coordinate disaster responses.

While these advancements are exciting, they also raise new ethical and societal questions. How do we manage the autonomy of embodied AI? What happens when AI decisions conflict with human values? Addressing these concerns will be essential.

### The Future of Human Interactions with Auto-Translation and Live AI Voice Conversations

I recently had a conversation with someone who spoke a different language. While we mostly understood each other, it required effort and patience. As someone passionate about languages, I see language barriers as speed bumps that can be overcome with dedication.

Now, imagine OpenAI's live conversation capabilities and real-time auto-translation as game-changers. Combine this with advancements like ElevenLabs' voice cloning, and we're on the brink of seamless cross-linguistic communication.

**Imagine attending an international conference where language barriers disappear. Attendees converse in their native languages while AI provides real-time translation, fostering deeper connections and collaborations.**


A quick demo of this process might look like this:

However, there are challenges that need to be addressed:

- **Real-Time Accuracy**: Ensuring translations capture not only words but also context and intent.
- **Nuances in Language**: Idioms, cultural references, and tone can be difficult for AI to interpret correctly.
- **Privacy and Security**: Protecting sensitive conversations from misuse or breaches during AI processing.

Despite these hurdles, the possibilities are inspiring. Seamless communication across languages could redefine global collaboration and innovation.

## Starlink Mini and the Future of Internet Access

I'm continually impressed by the potential of **Starlink Mini**. It's a game-changer for global internet access. A few weeks ago, I received mine, and it has exceeded my expectations. Whether I'm stationary in a remote area or traveling, it delivers a reliable internet connection that traditional hotspots often fail to provide.

This capability has allowed me to work from places I had previously thought impossible, such as the mountains or deserts, while staying connected to the rest of the world. The Starlink Mini isn't just about convenience—it’s about enabling a new kind of freedom.

Here are just a few ways this technology could transform the world:

- **Bridging the Digital Divide**: Remote and underserved communities can now access education, healthcare, and global markets, leveling the playing field.
- **Economic Empowerment**: Entrepreneurs in isolated regions can sell goods and services online, opening doors to new opportunities.
- **Disaster Response**: In areas affected by natural disasters, where infrastructure is compromised, Starlink Mini provides immediate communication channels for rescue and relief efforts.

This is just the beginning of what Starlink Mini could enable. As more people adopt this technology, the ripple effects on global connectivity and economic growth will be profound.

If you’re interested in trying it for yourself, Starlink is offering promotions that you can take advantage of:

- [Starlink Residential Free Month](https://www.starlink.com/residential?referral=RC-2613607-25159-62)
- [Starlink Mini Roam Service Free Month](https://www.starlink.com/roam?referral=RC-2613607-25159-62)

At the time of writing, the hardware is also discounted, making it an excellent time to explore the possibilities.

## Conclusion

As we enter 2025, the rapid pace of technological advancements presents both challenges and opportunities. AI agents are reshaping labor markets, auto-translation and live AI voice interactions are breaking down language barriers, and Starlink Mini is making reliable internet access a reality for people everywhere.

The future is full of unknowns, but one thing is certain: technology will continue to redefine the way we work, communicate, and live. How we choose to adapt, innovate, and collaborate will determine the impact of these changes on society as a whole.
