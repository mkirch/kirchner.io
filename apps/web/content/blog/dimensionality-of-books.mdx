title: "AI Dataset Creation is Missing a Piece of the Puzzle: Books are not 2D Objects"
description: "Books are not 2D objects, and yet, most AI datasets treat them as such. This post explores the limitations of current AI datasets and the potential benefits of incorporating 3D book data into AI training. It stems from a HN thread on Why Writing by Hand is Better for Memory and Learning, from Scientific American. The commments mention epub being a construct."
