## Key Hypothesis

- Hypothesis 1: North American Origin
  - Creation around 1440: Aztec and Mayan Influence on Native American Tribes in Southwestern United States, Arizona, and particularly the Nahua-speaking peoples of the region.
	- Transmission to Central Europe around 1582: The manuscript is carried to Central Europe by itinerant scholars, traders, or members of monastic orders. It was likely transported along with John Dee's obsidian mirror, which has been verified as originating from the Americas. Specifically, the obsidian came from the Aztec people, from near Mexico City in the obsidian deposit It is likely that the manuscript was part of the same collection as it traveled to Europe. The Aztecs used obsidian for various purposes, including tools, weapons, and ceremonial objects like mirrors, which were used in rituals and for divination. The mirror likely came to Europe through Spanish conquistadors who brought various artifacts back from their expeditions in the New World.  John Dee is believed to have come into possession of the obsidian mirror around 1582. 

- Hypothesis 2: John Dee’s Acquisition from Franciscan Sources
	- Franciscan Missions: Franciscan friars in the Americas document indigenous knowledge and create manuscripts, including the Voynich manuscript.
	- Spanish Ships: These manuscripts are sent back to Europe via Spanish ships.
	- Acquisition by John Dee: Dee acquires the manuscript through his networks, either via purchase, scholarly exchange, or intermediaries like book dealers.
	- Integration into Dee’s Library: Dee incorporates the manuscript into his collection, aligning with his interests in alchemy and esoteric knowledge.
- Hypothesis 3: John Dee’s Possession and Movement to Prague
	- Dee’s Journey to the Continent: In 1583, John Dee and Edward Kelley leave England for the Continent, taking Dee’s manuscripts, including the Voynich manuscript, with them.
	- Introduction to Rudolf II’s Court: Dee and Kelley present themselves at Rudolf II’s court in Prague, where they engage with the emperor and the intellectual community.
- Hypothesis 4: Transfer to Jacobus Sinapius
	- Dee’s Departure from Prague: As Dee prepares to leave Prague in 1589-1590, he ensures the manuscript’s safety by entrusting it to Jacobus Sinapius, Rudolf II’s personal physician and alchemist.
	- Sinapius’s Custody and Marking: Sinapius integrates the manuscript into his own collection, marking it with his name to ensure its recognition and preservation.
- Hypothesis 5: Subsequent Owners and Transmission
	- Post-Sinapius Transmission: After Sinapius’s death in 1622, the manuscript passes through the hands of other scholars at Rudolf’s court, such as Raphael Sobiehrd-Mnishovsky and Georgius Barschius.
	- Embedded in Intellectual Circles: The manuscript remains within the network of alchemists and intellectuals, contributing to its mystique and preservation.

## Known Unknowns

The Voynich manuscript, a mysterious book filled with strange symbols and drawings, has puzzled historians, cryptographers, and linguists for centuries. Despite numerous attempts to decipher its contents, the manuscript's text remains undeciphered. The book's author, origin, and purpose are all shrouded in mystery, adding to its enigmatic allure.

Here's some raw components I've been able to extract from the history surrounding the manuscript that I feel have been overlooked in previous attempts to understand it.

### Three Interesting Characters - Or One Incredibly Talented One

- [Jacobus Sinapius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobus_Sinapius)  (b. 1575 – d. 1622)
  -  Names used:
     -  Jakub Horčický
     -  Jacobus Sinapius de Tepenec
     -  Jacobus Horcicky 
     -  Jakub Horcicky de Tepenec
     -  Jakub Horčický z Tepence
  -  Background:
     -   A Czech pharmacologist, physician and alchemist , personal physician of Emperor Rudolf II.
     -   Name found in the Voynich Manuscript.
     -   He was a member of the Bohemian Brotherhood of the Rosy Cross.
- [RSM: Raphael Sobiehrd-Mnishovsky of Sebuzin and of Horstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raphael_Sobiehrd-Mnishovsky) (b. 1580-1644)
  - Names used:
    - Rafael Soběhrd Mnišovský
    - Rafael Soběhrd Mišovský
  - Background:
    - A Bohemian lawyer and writer. 
    - Held various secretarial, diplomatic, and judicial posts under Rudolf II, Mathias, Ferdinand II, and Ferdinand III, under whom Raphael was the attorney-general.
    - Mnishovsky was also a poet and cryptographer, and is associated with the mystery of the Voynich manuscript. According to a 1666 letter which was stored with the manuscript, Raphael had told the letter's writer, Marcus Marci, that the manuscript had originally belonged to Rudolf, who had purchased it for 600 gold ducats.
    - Friends with Bartosz Paprocki
    - Close friend of Jan Marek Marci from Kronland , and it was to him that Mnišovský was to reveal details about the Voynich manuscript. 
    - Klesl's secretary in Austria. Melchior Klesl was not only a diplomat, priest and governor, he was one of the most important people at the court. In 1585, he was appointed imperial councillor by Rudolf II, in 1611 Matthias placed Klesl at the head of his privy council (both facts from Wikipedia). In other words, he was for sure a very informed man. Beside that, I guess that ties between Prague and Graz were very close in those days, and, if I'm not mistaken, Graz lay on the road from Prague to Rome, so whoever traveled from Prague to Rome or backwards stopped in Graz. In other words, Graz was a good place to gather news and rumours.
    - In the letter that was found together with the manuscript, Marci states that Mnišovský told him that Emperor Rudolf II bought the manuscript for 600 gold coins, but in the chaos of the estate uprising, it disappeared from the Rudolfinum collections. 
    - For this reason, Mnišovský is sometimes referred to as the possible author of the manuscript, i.e. the one who, thanks to his interest in cryptography, created the work and, as ancient and mysterious, offered it to Emperor Rudolf for a high sum, thanks to which he also knew details about the fate of the manuscript, about its existence in Rudolf's collections otherwise do not contain information from other sources. Another indication is that in 1618 Mnišovský allegedly told Marci that he had created an indecipherable cipher. It is possible that the Voynich manuscript was meant to be a sample of it.
    - Mnišovský was strongly interested in alchemy and in secret writing. Possibly for Ferdinand III he wrote the Latin work: Constructio seu strues Tritemiana. Qui nullum unquam idiomatis bohemici calluit verbum, per eam in momento scribet convenienter bohemice quantum volet (etc). This is an adaptation of the method of Trithemius using the Czech language (E.4). The manuscript is now preserved in the library of the University of Uppsala, where it was transported by the Swedes during the 30-years war (E.5).
    - In 1630 he wrote two letters, to Vilem Slavata and to emperor Ferdinand II, to seek support for the famous alchemist Michael Sendivogius (E.6). In the second letter, we find many interesting statements: that he had studied alchemy for more than 30 years, that he studied many manuscripts of Rudolf, both in plaintext and cipher, and that he himself found many such manuscripts in the cloisters of Braunau and Kremsmünster. Furthermore, that he is one of the very few people with whom Sendivogius speaks freely. This is of interest as Sendivogius was long active in the service of Rudolf II.
    - The physician and minor poet Joannes Christofer Daisigner, composed a number of epigrams which included one about Mnišovský, in which he describes the latter as: Vincit Trithemium atque Gebrum: he defeats Trithemius and Geber (E.7). Daisigner was in Italy in 1639 or 1640, as one of the travel companions of Marci. (See the biography of Marci below for more details).
    - The historian Bohuslav Balbín, good friend of Marci, wrote about Mnišovský:
      - I knew the man, and for all his grave and stern face he was extremely kind and witty: I could give many examples of the fact.
    - One of his houses, called "at the three old women", was located round the corner from Marci's house. Image: ![JMM and RMS houses](https://www.voynich.nu/img/gallery/jmm_rms_houses.gif)
    - He appears to have been in Rome at roughly the same time as Barschius.

- [GB: Georgius Barschius (Baresch)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgius_Barschius) (approx b. 1580 or b. 1585 – d. between 1646 and 1662 )
  -  Names used:
    -  Georgius Barschius
    -  Jiří Barschius
    -  Jiří Barsch
    -  Jiri Baresch
    -  George Bareš
    -  Georg Baresch
    -  **Jiří Bareš**
    -  Jiřím Barešem ze Žinkov
  -  Background:
    -  He was a Bohemian physician and alchemist.
    -  He was a friend of Raphael Sobiehrd-Mnishovsky and Jan Marek Marci.
    -  He was the first known owner of the Voynich manuscript, which he received from Rudolf II.
    -  He was a member of the Bohemian Brotherhood of the Rosy Cross.
    -  Both in a letter written in 1641, and in his book of 1662, Marci mentions Barschius 'in the same breath' as Martinus Santinus S.J.. Santinus was one of Kircher's corresondents, and Barschius and Marci together had managed to convince this Jesuit of the usefulness of alchemy, after he was also originally skeptical (F.22). Santini also wrote to Kircher about an alchemical puzzle, using the typical 'Oedipus' terminology (F.23).
    -  Since only very few sources related to Barschius are available, note F.1 includes the complete list as it is presently known to me. Most of these sources have been found by Rafał Prinke and Josef Smolka. The following biography is the first and most detailed biography available for him. No portrait of Barschius is believed to survive.
    -  Relatively little is known about Barschius. 
    -  He was born in the village Synkov near Častolovice in Bohemia (F.2). His birth year is unknown. 
     - It can be estimated from the date of his baccalaureate 1602.
     - Barschius was catholic (F.6). Despite his rural origin, he studied at the Jesuit college of the Clementinum and received his bachelor's degree on 9 May 1602 and his master's degree on 14 May 1603, both in "liberal arts and philosphy". On 27 April 1605 he started studies in Rome, at the Sapienza university. We do not know how long he was there, and he does not seem to have obtained a doctor's degree. It is possible that he followed a legal study there. He may possibly have been in Rome at the same time as Mnišovský. He was certainly back in Bohemia in 1616.
     - Barschius must have first met Marci some time before 1625, probably around 1622. Since that time they were engaged in philosophical discussions. As from 1624, Barschius was registered as a citizen in Prague. It is not excluded that he already resided in Prague before. To obtain the citizenship, he presented a recommendation letter from Johann Otto Freiherr von Oppersdorff, lord of Častolovice, which was already prepared in 1616. He had two guarantors, named Lorenz Czybut and Kasspar Punczman, and no registration fee is mentioned.
     - Before 1622, Jan Marek Marci met and became friends with the philosopher Jiří Bareš from Žinkov (around 1585–1662), a graduate of Rome's Sapienza University, known by the name Georgius Barschius, nowadays more commonly known as Georg Baresch. He was considered a close friend of his, but his importance in Marci's biography is completely outside the significant events of Marci's biography - it concerns the ownership of a mysterious document, called the Voynich manuscript, which was discussed only in the last years of Marci's life...
     - From 1630 to 1646 Barschius worked as relator at the Highest Prague Burgrave court of justice (soud nejvyssiho purkrabstvi prazskeho). This was a high position, and it may be concluded that financially Barschius was well off.
     - Sometime between 1626 and 1636, Rafael Mnišovský spoke with Marci about the Voynich MS. At this time, Barschius may have already been the owner of the MS, in which case he would have been present at this discussion. In general, since both Barschius and Mnišovský were highly placed legal officials, and both shared a great interest in alchemy, it seems almost certain that both men knew each other.
     - In the second half of 1637 Barschius contacted Athanasius Kircher in Rome, in order to seek his help in interpreting the Voynich MS. His questions were included in a letter from the mathematician Theodor Moretus S.J., which has unfortunately not come down to us. He included some copies of text and drawings of the MS, and a sheet of other 'unknown writing' which he thought might be similar. This is the first known letter from any Bohemian scientist in the Kircher correspondence. It was triggered by the publication of Kircher's book "Prodromus Coptus", which appeared in 1636.
     - The reply from Kircher came only in March 1639, and is included in the scientific diary of Moretus. The second 'unknown writing' was recognised by Kircher, but not that of the Voynich MS. Barschius found the reply not adequate, and sent a second letter in 1639. This letter has been preserved, though another batch of transcription material of the Voynich MS, which he sent to Kircher with this letter, is also lost. In this second letter he presents Kircher with his view that the Voynich MS represents "Egyptian medicine" brought to Bohemia by a traveller. He stresses the importance he attaches to the study of medicine.
     - In Marci's 1640 letter to Kircher, he describes Barschius as his friend. He also calls him 'greatly skilled in chemical matters', the same epithet that he would later use in "Philosophia Vetus Restituta". With this letter, Marci sends some drawings of Barschius to Kircher, but also these have been lost. It is likely, but not certain, that these drawings were copies of Voynich MS pages. Marci stresses that Barschius is interested in this subject for the sake of medicine, and not for gold. This undoubtledly refers to their common interest in alchemy, a topic that Kircher would never accept.
     - Both in a letter written in 1641, and in his book of 1662, Marci mentions Barschius 'in the same breath' as Martinus Santinus S.J.. Santinus was one of Kircher's corresondents, and Barschius and Marci together had managed to convince this Jesuit of the usefulness of alchemy, after he was also originally skeptical. Santini also wrote to Kircher about an alchemical puzzle, using the typical 'Oedipus' terminology.
     - J. Fletcher mentions that Barschius had visited Kircher in Rome and on his way back wrote that he "admired Kircher's opera ingeniosissima", while referring to the letter from Barschius to Kircher. This quote does not appear there, and has not yet been found back elsewhere in the correspondence. Fletcher must have been mistaken, but this is worth a further investigation.
     - Barschius' name does not appear in the tax rolls called "Berní Rula". This means that in 1654, when these tax tolls were generated, Barschius may have already died, or alteratively, that he had no taxable income (e.g. a house). Barschius never married.
     - Apart from the one letter to Kircher, there is no extant writing of Barschius, and he seems to have spent the last years of his life studying the Voynich MS. At Barschius' death he left Marci his alchemical collection and library and we know that he died between 1646 and 1662, but we don't know more precisely when. Extrapolating his most probable birth years results in the time frame 1650-1655. No references to his death have been found in Marci's letters to Kircher.

### Their Connections, and their connnections' connections
- [Michael Sendivogius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Sendivogius) (b. 1556 or 1566 – d. 1636 or approx d. 1646)
  -  Names used:
     -  Michał Sędziwój
     -  Michal Sedziwoj (b. 1556)
     -  Divi Leschi Genus Amo
  -  Background:
     -   was a Polish alchemist, philosopher, and medical doctor. A pioneer of chemistry, he developed ways of purification and creation of various acids, metals and other chemical compounds. He discovered that air is not a single substance and contains a life-giving substance—later called oxygen—170 years before Scheele's discovery of the element. He correctly identified this "food of life" with the gas (also oxygen) given off by heating nitre (saltpetre).[1] This substance, the "central nitre", had a central position in Sendivogius' schema of the universe.
     -  Little is known of his early life: he was born in a noble family that was part of the Clan of Ostoja. His father sent him to study in university of Kraków but Sendivogius visited also most of the European countries and universities; he studied at Vienna, Altdorf, Leipzig and Cambridge. His acquaintances included John Dee and Edward Kelley. It was thanks to him that King Stephen Báthory agreed to finance their experiments.[4] In the 1590s he was active in Prague, at the famously open-minded court of Emperor Rudolf II.
     - Christian Rosenkreutz [connection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Sendivogius#cite_note-prinke-5)
       - Daniel Stolcius in his Viridarium Chymicum (1624) praises Sendivogius as the author of twelve books.[5] The most famous of these was his "New Chemical Light", published in 1604. Besides a relatively clear exposition of his theory on the existence of a "food of life" in air, his books contain various scientific, pseudo-scientific and philosophical theories, and were repeatedly translated and widely read among such worthies as Isaac Newton into the 18th century.
     - Further conenctions to Rosicrucianism [here](http://www.masonic.benemerito.net/msricf/papers/marples/marples-michael.sendivogius.pdf)
       - Sendivogius tried to promote a so-called secret society of "Unknown Philosophers" of which he drew-up the Statutes. 
       - Even ordinary citizens couldn't help but see the resemblance of Sendivogius' Society with the Society of the Rose & Cross Rosicrucians}which was founded by Fr. Christian Rosenkreutz. The resemblance was remarkably uncanny. 
       - Most importantly--"Sendivogius was considered by contemporary and succeeding generations of alchemists to be the true possessor of the 'great mystery' and a member of the Rosicrucians. He was greatly admired and cited in seventeenth- and eighteenth century alchemical treatises." It is a known fact that Sir Isaac Newton collected some of Michael Sendivogius' published treatises.
       - He was born on the 2nd of February1566 at either Skorsko or Lukawica, Poland; and died at Cravar, Silesia, in June 1636. His parents, Jacob Sedzimir and Catherine Pielsz Rogowska were both of noble families and had a small estate near Nowy Sacz, in the Cracow district of Poland. It is reported that young Michael traveled to and studied at (or at least visited) universities at Moscow, Russia; Sweden; England; Spain; Portugal; Italy where he studied the rare works of Paracelsus in The Vatican Library; Greece (where he was instructed by a patriarch of the Greek Orthodox Church); and Constantinople (now in modern-day Turkey). At this same time he was studying philosophy, medicine, rhetoric, Geometry, astronomy, mechanics, theology, and other subjects at the Universities of Cambridge, Frankfurt, Rostock, Wittenberg, Leipzig (in 1590), back to the University of Vienna (1591), and the University in Altdorf in 159495 and also Ingolstadt (both in Germany) and in Prague (in today's Czech Republic). 
       - It is notable that one of his fellow students while at Altdorf was Michael Maier, another confirmed Rosicrucian. For that time-period, Sendivogius was an exceptionally welltraveled man. 
     - **Connection to Paracelsus is notable**
       - [A new light of alchymie](https://wellcomecollection.org/works/nxy235ys) : taken out of the fountaine of nature, and manuall experience. To which is added a treatise of sulphur: / written by Micheel Sandivogius: i.e. anagram matically, divi Leschi genus amo. Also nine books of the nature of things, written by Paracelsus, viz. Of the generations growthes conservations life: death renewing transmutation separation signatures of naturall things. Also a chymicall dictionary explaining hard places and words met withall in the writings of Paracelsus, and other obscure authors. All which are faithfully translated out of the Latin into the English tongue, by J.F. M.D.
       - Critically important also there is that John French is J.F. who translated the works of Sendivogius into English. John French was a Rosicrucian and a member of the Invisible College. He was also a physician and an alchemist. He was a contemporary of Sir Isaac Newton and a friend of Robert Boyle. He was also a member of the Royal Society.
       - John French is chiefly remembered for publishing in 1651 The Art of Distillation, a detailed handbook of knowledge and practice at the time, said to be possibly the earliest definitive book on distillation. However, it has been claimed[1] that much of it was a translation of an earlier (1500) German text by Hieronymus Brunschwig.
       - JF only translatd the work of Sendivogius, Agrippa, and Johann Rudolf Glauber


John French was also the translator of Three Books of Occult Philosophy in 1651 (original: De Occulta Philosophia libri tres by Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa, although he was only identified as J.F. in that work.[2] All other English translations of the book available have been merely edited versions of his work.
- [Bartosz Paprocki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartosz_Paprocki) (b. 1540 or 1543 - d. 1614)
  - Names used:
    - Bartolomej Paprocký of Hlohol and Paprocké Vůla
  - Background: 
    - Friends with Raphael Sobiehrd-Mnishovsky
    - Polish and Czech writer, historiographer, translator, poet, heraldist and pioneer in Polish and Bohemian-Czech genealogy (often referred to as the "father of Polish and Bohemian-Czech genealogy").
    - Paprocki spent 22 years in Moravia and Bohemia. He learned the Czech language and wrote alongside new poems about the history and the coat of arms of Bohemia and Moravia. He also translated the poems of Jan Kochanowski.[1] Later he received Bohemian indygenat (nobility citizenship naturalization).
    - He was admirer of Michał Sędziwój's (Michael Sendivogius) scientific achievements, whom he dedicated the third part of his book "Ogród królewski..." published in 1599.
    - In 1610 at the end of his life and stricken religious wars in the Czech lands, Paprocki returned to Poland. Destitute he lived in Wąchock and Ląd monasteries. Paprocki died suddenly on 27 December 1614 in Lviv, and was buried in a crypt at the Franciscan abbey in the city of Lviv. Paprocki is considered the father of Polish and Bohemian-Czech genealogy and a valuable source of Polish, Moravian and Bohemian-Czech heraldry.[1][2] He was the author of many historical works, occasional poetry, satires, panegyrics and pamphlets.[2]
- [Jan Marek Marci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Marek_Marci) (b. 1595 – d. 1667)
  - Names used:
    - Johannes Marcus Marci
    - Jan Marek Marci
    - Jan Marek Marků
    - Ioannes Marcus Marci
  - Children:
    - Jan Jiří Marci (Johannes Georgius Marci) who was sent to live with Kircher in Rome. Born before 1672. He became a doctor of medicine in 1658. He married Judita Magdalena from Bavorov (†1675).
    - Jan Marek had a number of descendants. In 1674, his son Ludvík made a will in favor of his sister Barbara Cecilia Marci († apparently 1680) and bequeathed to her the mill under the village of Michle (called Pod Michlí) inherited from her father, which was to fall to her after his death or in the event that he entered spiritual order. Another son of Jan Marek was Jan Jiří († before 1672), who became a doctor of medicine in 1658. He married Judita Magdalena from Bavorov (†1675), who after his death married a second time to the knight Adam Šmuhará from Rochov and in 1672 sold her sister-in-law Barbora Cecilia Marci a quarter of the mill called Pod Michlí, which was apparently the last major family property.
    - As a doctor, Marci was very successful. He was appointed official physician to Ferdinand III and, after he soon died, to his successor Leopold I. In 1655 he cured the historian Bohuslaus Balbin from smallpox, a serious illness, after he had already been given up by three other doctors. Since that time the two men became good friends and Balbin started to write extensively about Marci's medical practices.
    - After a few minor publications, including works on squaring the circle, on longitude and a polemic against the Jesuit B.Conrad, Marci abandoned publication for a number of years. In 1655, he sent his son Johannes Georg to Rome, entrusting him to Kircher's care. In 1658 Marci took leave from his university post as dean of the faculty of medicine, in order to accompany Leopold I on his triumphant coronation tour.

    - His next major publication was "Philosophia vetus restituta", in 1662. In this, Marci confirms his original philosophical ideas that had upset the Jesuits, particularly Arriaga. In this book he also mentions that Baresch had been his friend for 40 years, had died and had left him his alchemical library, which apparently included the Voynich MS.

    - There is a gap in the correspondence to Kircher from 1658 to 1665. It is not clear whether Marci did not write to Kircher during these years, or whether these letters have been lost. Marci's penultimate letter to Kircher is the one accompanying the Voynich MS, written in August 1665. This letter, like the last surviving one that was sent one month later, were again written by the same scribe who wrote the letter from Hornhausen (see note G.23). In December 1666 he wrote his last will, in which he bequeathed his entire valuable library to his son Johannes Ludwig. Because of his degraded eye sight he could not sign his will at all. It was signed only by 3 witnesses - 2 professors of the medical faculty (Marci's former students Franchimont and Forberger) and by Christophorus (Krystof) Kyblin, a legal person. Two letters written by G.A. Kinner to Kircher in early 1666 and early 1667 include questions by the ailing Marci, about Kircher's success in decipering the mysterious MS that he had sent to him.
    - Marci died on the 10th of April 1667, in the 72nd year of his life, from a cerebreal haemorrage. A Jesuit biography of Marci states, that a few days before his death he became a member of the Society of Jesus. Modern historians are skeptical about these events, and it is considered possible, that he was no longer conscious when this happened, if it did at all. Marci was buried in the Jesuit crypt in the S.Salvator church in the Clementinum, close to his adversary Arriaga, who died at about the same time. The crypt was investigated in 1967 by a small team including Zdeňek Servít and Josef Smolka, but the graves had already been disturbed before that.
    - Some works of Marci have been published posthumously by his student J. Dobrzensky de Nigro Ponte (himself later Rector Magnificus of the Charles University), who used Balbín's notes. This included "Liturgia Mensis", devoted partly to epilepsy, published 11 years after Marci's death.
    - Marci's library, which should have also included the remains of Barschius' library, and possibly the letters he received from Kircher, was inherited by his son Johannes Ludwig. The latter entered the Augustinian monastery of Zahan (Sagan in Silesia), where he deposited this library. From there it disappeared without a trace. The letters from Kircher to Marci have also never been found. Marci was survived by his pupils Sebastian Christian Zeidler, Jacobus Forberger and Nicolaus Franchimont of Franckenfeldt. None of them have written to Kircher, or at least no such letters are extant. One letter from Dobrzensky to Kircher has been preserved. Another letter from Ardensbach to Kircher, written in 1668 and disussing Marci's interest in alchemy, is published in Smolka (2016).
    - [Critical article](https://www.pozitivni-noviny.cz/cz/clanek-2012040011)
    - Before 1622, he met and became friends with the philosopher Jiří Bareš from Žinkov (around 1585–1662), a graduate of Rome's Sapienza University, known by the name Georgius Barschius, nowadays more commonly known as Georg Baresch. He was considered a close friend of his, but his importance in Marci's biography is completely outside the significant events of Marci's biography - it concerns the ownership of a mysterious document, called the Voynich manuscript, which was discussed only in the last years of Marci's life...

    - Long story short, his family is: 
      - His wife, married around 1630, when he was about 35 years old, whose first name is not known, was the daughter of the famous gem cutter Octavio Misseroni, who had come to Prague from Milan in 1588 to work at Rudolf's court. She was therefore also the sister of Dionysius Misseroni, also a gem cutter and later custodian of Rudolf's Kunstkammer. This marriage immediately placed him in the high society of Prague.
      - 1631: First son Johannes Georg (Jan Jiři) born. who was sent to live with Kircher in Rome in October 1655, which we know from a letter sent in Oct 1655. He became a doctor of medicine in 1658. He married Judita Magdalena from Bavorov (†1675).

        -Joined the Augustinian order and became a canon in Zahán. When he was elevated to nobility in 1654, part of the title included the right to recognize illegitimate children. On the basis of this right, Jan Marek recognized his daughter Kateřina Singerová in Litomyšl in 1662.
        - It is known that Jan Marek inherited a collection of alchemical writings from his friend Bareš, which was then inherited by his son Jan Ludvík, but it is no longer clear what happened to it after that.
        - **Today, Marek's name is cited abroad mainly in connection with the mysterious Voynich or Vojnič manuscript, which Marek inherited together with Bareš's alchemical collection.**
