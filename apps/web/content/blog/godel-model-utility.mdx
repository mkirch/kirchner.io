## A new model for the utility of new models

When wrestling with the utility of new models, I found myself retracing the steps of ancient philosophers and mathematicians. From Plato's realm of forms to Gödel’s groundbreaking theorems, the path was enlightening.

### Plato's Realm and the Challenges of Representation Learning

In the heart of Plato's philosophy lies the concept of ideal forms. Just as he pondered over the true essence of a circle or a triangle, we today grapple with teaching machines the essence of a cat, a song, or an emotion. How can we, through layers of artificial neurons, mirror this Platonic realization?

### Gödel's Theorems and the Limits of Computation

Gödel shattered the foundations of mathematics by proving that within any logical system, there exist truths that can't be proven. As I delved deeper into neural networks, I saw parallels. Are there aspects of understanding forever out of reach
